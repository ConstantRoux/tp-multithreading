## Overview

This Python-based framework facilitates distributed task execution using multiprocessing. The architecture includes a Boss component responsible for task distribution and Minion components that perform assigned tasks. The framework utilizes Python's multiprocessing module and provides a simple way to distribute and process tasks across multiple workers.

## Key Features

- **Boss-Minion Architecture:** Designed for efficient task distribution in a distributed environment.
- **Multiprocessing:** Utilizes Python's multiprocessing capabilities for parallel execution of tasks.
- **Task Management:** Provides classes for managing tasks, results, and communication between the Boss and Minions.
- **Example Implementations:** Includes example implementations for Boss, Minion, and Task classes to help you get started.
- **Unit Tests:** Ensures the reliability and correctness of core functionalities with unit tests.
